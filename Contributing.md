# Contributing

## If you wish to submit a PR with changes

- Make sure all tests pass once you have finished incorporating changes by using `npm test`. The test suite [uses `mocha`](https://mochajs.org/).
- If you are adding functionality it would be highly appreciated if you included test coverage.

## Filing issues

- If you file an issue, it is very helpful if you provide examples and either a demo or a link to the code in-place when possible.
- Issues that are waiting on a contributor's response may be closed after several days of inactivity.
